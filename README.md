# HoyoSimulation

This is a Discord Bot to allow members to simulate Warps / Pulls from Hoyoverse games in your Discord Server.

Currently it only supports Character and Light Cone Warps for Honkai Star Rail, however I will eventually add Genshin, HI3 and ZZZ items.

## Planned Features
 - "Special" Pulls 
 - Improved Inventory System
 - Admin Interface to manage items, etc
 - Server Specific Settings
 
## TODO
 - Make Shardable (Support over 100 Servers)

## Requirements

 - MySql or (MariaDB)
 - [CloudTheWolf.DSharpPlus.Scaffolding](https://github.com/CloudTheWolf/CloudTheWolf.DSharpPlus.Scaffolding) - (This will run the actual bot as a SystemD Service. Docker is not currently supported)

 
## Demo

A fully working version of the bot can be found on the Discord App Directory here https://discord.com/application-directory/1255955874745417932 


## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome!

Escpecially if you want to go through all Genshin/ZZZ Characters / weapons.
